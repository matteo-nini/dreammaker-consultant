# Dreammaker Consultant

### Description
**Dreammaker Consultant** it's a consultant website about traffic permit and transport. <br/><br/>

### Build With
For this project i've used *HTML5*, *CSS3* and *Javascript*!

### How i made it
Using **Trello** for organize tasks, i have split the website in 9 specified sections:<br/><br/>
1. Landing homepage
      + This is the homepage, here you can find a *transparent navigation bar* that become white when you're scrolling. **That's JavaScript magic!**<br/>
2. Services section
      + Here you can find all the services, when you mouse-hover a service, the *CSS3* animation appear.<br/>
3. People section
      + Here you can read about people, they are in quick turnaround! <br/>
4. Video section
      + In this section there is a big video. I've code it all with *divs (html)* and images, but in the HTML code, you can find a _video tag_ commented, if you want to code it!<br/>
5. Q&A section
      + Here you can find all the users's FAQ. In this section, i've use JavaScript for the *accordion menu* and the *"Load more"* button (that loads more questions).<br/>
6. Features section
      + In this section you can find all the best features you can have, by getting a permit!<br/>
7. Reviews section
      + In this section you'll find the users's reviews. I've use **JavaScript arrays** for building the slider, that change from one two other review. One array for *names*, one for the *avatars*, one for the *review contents* and one for the *user ratings*!<br/>
8. Login section
      + In this section you can find a login form, where you can insert your name, and your password. For this form, with JavaScript, i've *handled the errors* and check the *password validation.*<br/>
9. Footer Section
      + Here you can find the stuff that always goes in the footer section :smile: <br/>
<br/><br/>
And last not least, using a **767.98px CSS breakpoint** (Iphone X breakpoint), i've done the mobile website version too. In this case, i've use Javascript to handle the *navigation bar* and the *menu icon*.
